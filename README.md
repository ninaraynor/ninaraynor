I graduated from Binghamton University with a BA in English and Graphic Design. I have always had an interest in art, and I enjoy working with mixed media and creating digital work.  You can find some of my :art: work here: https://ninaraynor.wixsite.com/ninaraynor

I have worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am currently working to further my knowledge in the field and learn back end as well.
